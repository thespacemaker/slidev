# What is GPT-3?
## The future of AI

GPT3 is an AI model that uses neural network machine learning to generate text almost indistinguishable from text generated by humans (Natural Language Processing)

- Generative Pre-trained Transformer, third generation
- Developed by OpenAI in 2020
- Microsoft invested $1 Billion in OpenAI in 2020 to become the exclusive licensee.

# What is a Neural Network?

<!--
- Like the human brain, a neural network takes inputs from multiple sources and transforms them into a cohesive output.
- Language prediction based on patterns
- Uses coding and mathematical algorithms

# How Does GPT3 work?

Neural networks need to be trained. The more training a neural network has, the more accurate it becomes.

- GPT-3 was trained by text on the internet
- Has over **175 billion** machine learning parameters.

  - Before GPT-3, the largest neural network only had 10 billion parameters.

<!--
- This means that with very little input text, GPT-3 can generate a significant amount of relevant text that is convincing enough to appear that a human wrote it.
